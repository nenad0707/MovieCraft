## üîç Architecture Overview

MovieCraft follows **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring a separation of concerns and maintaining flexibility for future improvements. The project is structured in the following layers:

### Layers Overview

1. **MovieCraft.Client**: The Blazor WebAssembly front-end where the user interacts with the app.
2. **MovieCraft.Server**: The backend API that processes data, connects to databases, and handles business logic.
3. **MovieCraft.Shared**: Shared models and DTOs between client and server to ensure type safety and reduce duplication.
4. **MovieCraft.Application**: Contains the core business logic, including the **MediatR** handlers for CQRS operations.
5. **MovieCraft.Infrastructure**: Manages external services, including **Entity Framework** for database interactions and **Azure AD B2C** for authentication.
6. **MovieCraft.Domain**: Contains domain models and aggregates for the application's core entities.

---

## üéØ Key Components and Design Decisions

1. **Blazor Hosted Architecture**: The application is divided into **Client**, **Server**, and **Shared** projects. This provides a clear separation between frontend and backend, making the app highly scalable and maintainable.

2. **Clean Architecture**: The project strictly follows Clean Architecture, with separation of concerns between core business logic, external services, and the presentation layer. CQRS pattern is implemented using **MediatR**, ensuring a clean flow of commands and queries.

3. **Azure AD B2C**: Provides a highly secure and scalable authentication solution, allowing users to log in seamlessly and manage their own favorite movies list.

4. **TMDb API Integration**: The app fetches real-time movie data from TMDb, including posters, trailers, and detailed movie descriptions.

5. **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a great experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

## üîê Authentication with Azure AD B2C

MovieCraft uses **Azure Active Directory B2C** to handle user authentication. Setting this up ensures a smooth and secure login experience for users. Here‚Äôs a simplified breakdown of how **Azure AD B2C** is integrated into the application:

1. **Azure AD B2C Setup**: To use this service, you need to set up your **Azure AD B2C** tenant. Follow the [Azure AD B2C Setup Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant) to create your tenant and configure your policies.

2. **Application Registration**: Once your tenant is ready, register two applications:

- **Server API Application**: Used by the backend to validate tokens and manage user information.
- **Client Application**: Used by the frontend Blazor WebAssembly client to authenticate users and obtain access tokens.

3. **Configure Redirect URIs**: Ensure you have proper **Redirect URIs** for both local development (`https://localhost:5001`) and production.

4. **AppSettings Configuration**: Add your **Tenant ID**, **Client ID**, and **Scopes** to the `appsettings.json` file for both the Client and Server projects.

5. **Testing the Flow**: Once configured, test the login flow to ensure that users can log in, manage their favorites, and log out securely.

For more detailed instructions on how to configure **Azure AD B2C**, refer to the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/).

## üíª Frontend Design Details

### Modular and Declarative Components

MovieCraft uses a modular approach for all UI components, ensuring they can be reused and adapted for different parts of the application. Components such as **ActionButtons**, **SearchInput**, and **Carousel** are implemented declaratively, making the codebase clean and easy to maintain.

### Glassmorphism Effect in UI

The **NavMenu** and **MainLayout** components implement a **Glassmorphism** design, providing a modern and sleek look. This effect is achieved using CSS properties like **backdrop-filter** and **blur**, combined with subtle shadows and transparency. It adds a layer of sophistication to the app's visual identity, making the interface both functional and visually engaging.

### 3D Coverflow Carousel

The movie browsing experience is enhanced with a 3D **Coverflow** effect in the **Carousel** component, achieved using **Swiper.js**. This feature not only looks impressive but also adds an intuitive interaction model for users to explore popular movies. The combination of **Blazor** and **JavaScript Interop** (JS Interop) ensures smooth integration of this advanced UI feature.
